# TaleSpire States Plugin

This unofficial TaleSpire plugin is for adding lines of text above a mini
to provide visible information such a mini states (e.g. poisoned, frozen, etc).

## Change Log

1.0.0: Initial release

## Install

Install using R2ModMan or similar.

## Usage

Select a mini and then press the States shortcut keys (defaults to CTRL+S but can be changed in R2ModMan) to activate the Stats dialog.
Enter some text. If there are commas in the text, they will used to separate the text into multiple lines. The intention of this plugin
is to add information about the character states/conditions such as Poisoned, Exhausted, Unconcious, On Fire, etc. However, the plugin
can be used to display any text so it could be use for many other purposes.

To ensure compatability with Custom Mini Plugin, the text should not contain any colon (:) characters.

## Stealth Mode

The plugin synchronizes the text with the mini's stealth mode. When the mini is hidden due to Stealth, the text will also be hidden.
